Quick Plan (Actionable)

• Direction: Long  
• Order Type: Buy Limit  
• Trigger: Limit pullback into 15m bullish OB/FVG created by the impulsive break-up; look for wick into zone and rejection to hold  
• Entry: 4,424 – 4,438  
• Stop Loss: 4,398  
• Take Profit(s): TP1 4,480 / TP2 4,545  
• Conviction: 62%  
• Setup: Pullback to OB/FVG/SR confluence (15m) in line with 4H uptrend  
• Short Reasoning: 4H trend up; 15m flipped bullish after strong displacement; aiming to buy the first meaningful pullback into the gap/OB with clear invalidation below the base

Full Breakdown
• Technical View (HTF + Intraday): 4H/1H/15m structure  
- 4H: Broad uptrend with higher highs/higher lows. Pullback over last sessions but still above prior 4H higher-low cluster; buyers defended and momentum is stabilizing.  
- 1H: Recent downswing produced lower highs; latest session shows a sharp bullish impulse reclaiming mid-range; immediate supply sits 4,500–4,560.  
- 15m: Clean trend change: break of prior lower-high and displacement up, leaving a fresh bullish FVG/OB around 4,424–4,438; minor consolidation just under 4,480.

• Fundamental View (Calendar + Sentiment):  
- Calendar image shows no high-impact releases today (Sunday). Weekend crypto flow; news-light backdrop. Sentiment neutral-to-cautious after recent pullback.

• Tech vs Fundy Alignment: Match | Conditions quiet, allowing technicals to drive. Only headwind is 1H supply overhead.

• Conditional Scenarios:  
1) Continuation buy-stop: If 15m closes above 4,500 and retests/holds above 4,500, consider Buy Stop with SL below retest low, aiming for 4,560 then 4,620.  
2) Bearish rejection: If 15m prints SFP above 4,500–4,520 and closes back below 4,490 with retest failing, a tactical short to 4,430 then 4,380 is valid.  
3) Invalidation long: 15m body close below 4,400 and retest holds below → cancel long idea; momentum likely rotates lower toward 4,360/4,320.

• Surprise Risk: Sudden crypto headlines (ETF/regs, large liquidations), weekend liquidity pockets causing wicks and slippage.

• Invalidation: 15m close below 4,400 (or hard stop 4,398) negates bullish pullback structure.

• One-liner Summary: Buy the 15m FVG/OB pullback around 4,42x–4,43x with tight risk for a push into 4,48x then 4,54x while monitoring 1H supply at 4,50x–4,56x.

Detected Structures (X-ray):
• 4H: Uptrend; corrective pullback; higher-low defended; room to retest recent highs if 1H caps break.  
• 1H: Counter-trend rally inside a broader pullback; supply 4,50x–4,56x.  
• 15m: BOS to the upside; bullish FVG/OB at 4,424–4,438 from impulsive leg; minor range under 4,48x.

Candidate Scores (tournament):
- Long — Pullback to 15m OB/FVG — 68 — 4H up, fresh 15m displacement with clear invalidation; nearby 1H supply trims score.  
- Long — Breakout+Retest over 4,500 — 66 — Good trigger but right into 1H supply; would need strong follow-through.  
- Short — SFP at 4,50x–4,52x — 59 — Decent liquidity play vs 1H supply, but fights 4H uptrend.

Final Table Summary:
| Instrument | Bias | Entry Zone | SL | TP1 | TP2 | Conviction % |
| ETHUSD | Long | 4,424–4,438 | 4,398 | 4,480 | 4,545 | 62 |
